# **The Libre Sample Pack**
##### *A free sample pack*
---
## **What is this?**

It is a free (as in freedom) and collaborative sample and preset pack, a bit more intended for Linux musicians, since all presets will be for Linux plugins.

### **Why?**

Because freedom is cool. Also because Linux music production is a bit bare in resources regards and it would be nice to change that.

### **By who?**

By Linux musicians, for Linux musicians.

## **To contribute**
You can contribute with samples or presets as long as they're yours and correctly organized and formatted.

### Formatting

- All files should have a tag in the form of `@your-name` at the end of the name. Example: `heavy snare 1 @teaboi.wav`
- All presets should be in their own plugin's folder: All Helm presets on `presets/helm`, all Surge presets on `presets/surge` and so on.
